#  Intelligent System Applications / Aplik√°cie inteligentn√Ωch syst√©mov 

### Applied Machine Learning - ISA_I course @ FIIT STU in Bratislava

By completing the course, students will gain knowledge about the development and deployment of real-world intelligent system applications. Through lectures, exercises and projects, students will cover the theory, practical knowledge and skills that underpin **applied machine learning** in terms of building **intelligent system applications** with respect to **data protection**. The educational outcomes will provide students with the opportunity to enhance their understanding of machine learning specifics in application domains like e-commerce, monitoring systems, and remote sensing. Working on individual projects will encourage students to come up with their own ideas for implementing intelligent applications in both the **development** and **deployment** phases.
